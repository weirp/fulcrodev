  "## Exercise 1

TODO: Split this into smaller bits.

  OK, you've still got a plain React component. `defui` just makes a React class.

  This exercise is about connecting the dots. The rules for co-located queries are
  summarized here:

  - The interfaces for IQuery etc are declared `static`. This is not a cljs keyword, it is
  an invention of the macro. It causes the macro to place those things on the generated React class.
  - A `defui` component need not have a query. These are known as stateless components.
  - If a component *has* a query, it must be its own. Do not embed a query of another component as the full query
  of another (you must at least use a join if this is what you want to do).

  Finish building out the suggested goal interface using Om components with co-located queries.

  Remember that you will now have to obtain your properties from `this` using `om/props`.

  This file (just above this card's source) contains starter code. When correct, this card should render
  correctly. Note that this card does not detect the error of using another component's query as
  the full query.
